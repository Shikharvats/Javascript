Memoization in Javascript

This Project will have different important concepts used in Javascript currently I added on file which 
shows how Memoization works in Javascript.
I have added a function called Calc which will add numbers and send their sum as result.
I have added another function Memoize which is a call back function and it will store result in 
cache and when my prog first run it will run calc function but froms second time it will 
use cache and will never run whole calc function again.
